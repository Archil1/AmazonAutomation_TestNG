# Project Title
This is a demo automation framework built with TestNG for testing the SauceDemo web application.
It covers multiple end-to-end test scenarios including login, product validation, cart operations, and checkout flows.
The framework is integrated with Jenkins to enable Continuous Integration (CI), ensuring automated test execution on every code push and improving overall testing efficiency and reliability.


## Prerequisites

- [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) installed and running.
- Java, Docker, or other dependencies as required by your project.
- (Optional) Jenkins plugins needed (e.g., Pipeline, Git, Docker, etc.)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. **Configure Jenkins:**
   - Create a new Pipeline job in Jenkins.
   - Point the pipeline to your repository (via GitHub integration or by specifying the repo URL).
   - If using a `Jenkinsfile` in the repo, Jenkins will use it automatically.

3. **Run the Pipeline:**
   - Click **Build Now** in Jenkins to start the pipeline.
   - Monitor the build progress through the Jenkins web UI.

## Jenkins Pipeline Example
